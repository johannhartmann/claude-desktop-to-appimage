# Claude Desktop for Linux (AppImage)

This project was inspired by [aaddrick claude-desktop-debian](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian) for running Claude Desktop natively on Linux. Their work provided valuable insights into the application's structure and the native bindings implementation.

The main changes are:

- No `sudo` required (if some dependencies are missing, it will guide you to install them)
- AppImage generation instead of a `.deb` package

# How to use it

## 1. Download the repo

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/fsoft72/claude-desktop-to-appimage.git
cd claude-desktop-to-appimage

# Build the AppImage
./build-appimage.sh

# The script will automatically:
# - Check for required dependencies (installation must be done by the user)
# - Download and extract resources from the Windows version
# - Create a proper AppImage
```

Requirements:

- Any Debian-based Linux distribution
- Node.js >= 12.0.0 and npm

## Command line

The script accepts the following command line arguments:

```bash
Usage: ./build-appimage.sh [--appimagetool <path>] [--bundle-electron] [--keep-installer] [--clean-cache] [--version] [-h|--help]
  --appimagetool <path>   Path to appimagetool (default: /home/fabio/data/opt/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage)
  --bundle-electron       Bundle Electron with the AppImage (default: 0)
  --keep-installer        Keep installer outside build directory to avoid re-downloading
  --clean-cache           Remove cache directory and exit
  --claude-download-url   URL to download the Claude Desktop installer (default: https://storage.googleapis.com/osprey-downloads-c02f6a0d-347c-492b-a752-3e0651722e97/nest-win-x64/Claude-Setup-x64.exe)
  -v, --version          Show version information
  -h, --help             Show this help message

./build-appimage.sh [--appimagetool <path>] [--bundle-electron] [-h|--help]
```

You can run the script without arguments, and it will use the default values.

```bash
./build-appimage.sh
```

Or you can specify some options:

- `--appimagetool <path>`: Specify the path to the `appimagetool` executable (default is `/home/fabio/data/opt/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage`).
- `--bundle-electron`: Bundle Electron with the AppImage (default is `0`, meaning it will not bundle Electron, and will use the system-installed version if available (the AppImage will be smaller, but it may only work on your system)).
- `--keep-installer`: Keep the downloaded installer outside the build directory to avoid re-downloading it on subsequent builds. This is useful if you are making some experimental builds and want to avoid downloading the installer every time. If you use this option, remember to call `--clean-cache` to remove the cache directory when you finish testing.
- `--clean-cache`: Remove the cache directory and exit. This is useful if you want to start fresh without any cached data.
- `--claude-download-url <url>`: Specify a custom URL to download the Claude Desktop installer. This is useful if you want to use a different version or source of the installer.
- `-v, --version`: Show version information of the script.
- `-h, --help`: Show the help message with available options.

# How it works

Claude Desktop is an Electron application packaged as a Windows executable. Our build script performs several key operations to make it work on Linux:

1. Downloads and extracts the Windows installer
2. Unpacks the app.asar archive containing the application code
3. Replaces the Windows-specific native module with a Linux-compatible implementation
4. Repackages everything into a proper Debian package

The process works because Claude Desktop is largely cross-platform, with only one platform-specific component that needs replacement.

## The Native Module Challenge

The only platform-specific component is a native Node.js module called `claude-native-bindings`. This module provides system-level functionality like:

- Keyboard input handling
- Window management
- System tray integration
- Monitor information

Our build script replaces this Windows-specific module with a Linux-compatible implementation that:

1. Provides the same API surface to maintain compatibility
2. Implements keyboard handling using the correct key codes from the reference implementation
3. Stubs out unnecessary Windows-specific functionality
4. Maintains critical features like the Ctrl+Alt+Space popup and system tray

The replacement module is carefully designed to match the original API while providing Linux-native functionality where needed. This approach allows the rest of the application to run unmodified, believing it's still running on Windows.

## Build Process Details

The build script (`build-appimage.sh`) handles the entire process:

1. Checks for a Debian-based system and required dependencies
2. Downloads the official Windows installer
3. Extracts the application resources
4. Processes icons for Linux desktop integration
5. Unpacks and modifies the app.asar:
   - Replaces the native module with our Linux version
   - Updates keyboard key mappings
   - Preserves all other functionality
6. Creates a proper AppImage with:
   - Desktop entry for application menus
   - System-wide icon integration
   - Proper dependency management
   - Post-install configuration
